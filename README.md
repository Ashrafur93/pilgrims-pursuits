## Introduction

Pilgrim's Pursuits is a blogsite dedicated to providing comprehensive information about the Islamic pilgrimage, Hajj. It aims to address the challenges of learning about and booking Hajj packages, offering users the ability to read and write information to broaden their perspectives and simplify their decision-making process. This website is developed as part of my Individual Capstone Project for the AI Augmented Full Stack Web Developer course by Code Institute, with a focus on Django, database management, and CRUD functionality.

## UX Design Process

  - [GitHub Projects Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Ashrafur93/projects/6)

- **Wireframes:**

  I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes and used the Code Institute Walkthrough Project as the template for my layout. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was introduced to me via the Code Institute course and I have found it to be easy to learn and use. It is great for designing websites on different platforms and viewports, which helps to plan for responsive sites.
